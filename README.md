- [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md) hosts the "Infrastructure as Code" descriptions

## Build

### Environment Variables

To interact with the required package and container registries, the following environment variables should be set

```console
export GITHUB_PACKAGE_USERNAME=
export GITHUB_PACKAGE_PASSWORD=
```

### Compile

To build all compilation artifacts (without tests), you can invoke

```console
./mvnw -s settings.xml install -DskipTests
```

### Test

To build all compilation artifacts (including tests), you can invoke

```console
./mvnw -s settings.xml install
```

## Containerizing, Registering and Deployment

Knowledge Agents builds all containers using docker technology. The docker buildfiles are part of the respective source code repositories.

### Containers

To build all artifacts (including compilation artifacts, tests and container images), you can invoke

```console
./mvnw -s settings.xml install -Pwith-docker-image
```

### Registry

To register all artifacts (including compilation artifacts, tests and container images) into their respective registries, you can invoke

```console
./mvnw -s settings.xml deploy -Pwith-docker-image
```

### Deployment

Knowledge Agents containers will be deployed very individually.

We provide a sample environment (dataspace consisting of three business partners) using docker-compose (for local deployment) and helm (for cloud/cluster deployment) technology. 

The docker compose files and helm charts can be found in the  [infrastructure](infrastructure) folder.

## Running Against the Services and APIs / Integration Tests

You may use/export/fork this online [Postman Workspace/Collecion](https://www.postman.com/catena-x/workspace/catena-x-knowledge-agents/collection/2757771-6a1813a3-766d-42e2-962d-3b340fbba397?action=share&creator=2757771) a copy of which is embedded [here](cx_ka_pilot.postman_collection.json). 

It contains collection of sample interactions with the various sub-products in several environments (e.g. local, integration) and tailored to the sample dataspace. 

Also integrated there is a folder with the integrations tests.
