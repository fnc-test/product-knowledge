# Catena-X Skill modules

The skill modules is a set of UI components which allow to define and test new skills for the [Skill Gym](../skill_gym) and the [Knowledge Explorer](../knowledge_explorer)! 

The modules uses the [Skill Framework](../skill_framework) and the [Catena-X shared component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cx-portal-shared-components).

If you like to reuse the modules in your own project, do the following steps:

First create a new react app and add dependencies for the library and Material UI.
We are using npm and TypeScript, if you prefer yarn or JavaScript use those.

    npm create react-app sample-skill-app --template typescript
    npm install @catenax-ng/skill-modules


Start the development server

    
    npm start


Edit `src/index.tsx` and add one of the available modules like "AssetView" to it.

    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <AssetView />
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('app')
    );
